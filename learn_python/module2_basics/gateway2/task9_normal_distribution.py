    * You will need to import three things from `math <https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html>`_
    * Its possible to write this in a single statement (not including the imports)

.. warning::
    If your test fails., the test for this task will display a plot of your 
    normal distribution so you can see whats wrong. If your VSCode is full-screened, 
    the plot may be hidden behind it. The test suite will pause while the plot window
    is open, and only resume after you close the window.
