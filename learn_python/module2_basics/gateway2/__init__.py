"""
This assignment is designed to exercise your knowledge of the basics of
Python covered in the module 2 lesson. Take your time and if you get
frustrated ask for help! Some of these tasks can be tricky and some of
the later ones especially are designed to challenge your handle of 
looping, conditionals, sequence indexing and the syntactic sugar that
python provides around iteration. This is the hard part, but
it is the gateway to the fun part! If you get intimidated looking at 
a large block of hard to understand code, take a breath and focus on
each line one by one - and test them in ipython to see what they do!

To run these tests from the command line:

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        poetry run pytest -k test_gateway2

The tests will run for each task as you attempt to do the task - if no
implementation is found the test will be skipped. Once you have completed
the gateway assignment you should see that all tests pass with no skipped
tests (but tests from other modules will be "deselected")!

To run a specific test use its full name:

    .. code-block:: bash

        poetry run pytest -k test_gateway2_is_even

Remember, if you want to run one of your functions outside of a pytest
run you can do so like this:

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        poetry run ipython

    .. code-block:: python

        >> from learn_python.module2.gateway2 import my_function
        >> my_function()

.. note::
    
    Print statements and pdb or ipdb are both useful for debugging!
